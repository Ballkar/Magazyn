Project of simple warehouse in simple PHP.

## Motvation

  - I wanted to use all advantages of OOP.

## Technologies

 -  First, download files:
 
 - If you are using XAMPP, place files in your \xampp\htdocs directory
 
 - Start local Apache and MySQL.
 
 - Create database 'magazyn' and import from Magazyn-master/magazyn.sql
 
 - You can now access the server at http://localhost/magazyn-master/
